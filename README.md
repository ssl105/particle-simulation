# particle-simulation
A straight-forward particle system that uses the forward Euler method applying simple physics to the particles.
Forces applied on the particles are a gravitational force and aerodynamic drag force. 
A basic collision detection is implemented with the ground plane using the impulse to change the direction
of the particle. I also incorporated an Anttweakbar GUI with adjustable mean and variance variables.
